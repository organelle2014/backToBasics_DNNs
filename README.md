I am working on a new project in DNNs and how to train models. I came up with this simple template that can help you train your dataset. However, before getting into details, you must first learn how to order or pre-process your dataset before subjecting it to training.


It is simple, you need to replace 'your' with whatever name you want. replace the path with wherever you saved your dataset.





You can customize this code to evaluate other performance metrics, such as precision, recall, or F1 score, depending on the specific problem you are trying to solve.    

You can also save the model and its weights to disk using the save() method of the model object, so that you can reuse it later and/or load an already saved model as provided in the template
