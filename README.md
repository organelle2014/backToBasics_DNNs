I am working on a new project in DNNs and how to train models. I came up with this simple template that can help you train your dataset. However, before getting into details, you must first learn how to order or pre-process your dataset before subjecting it to training.


It is simple, you need to replace 'your' with whatever name you want. replace the path with wherever you saved your dataset.
